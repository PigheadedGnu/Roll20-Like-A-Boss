You can find the macros I use with these scripts here: 

### Intro ###
I use the OGL sheet because of 5eTools compatibility and stability. The Shaped sheet has a lot of nice features, but it breaks a lot.
My philosophy on scripts is that I can add as many as I want, but:
- I avoid scripts that might step on each other's toes
- I try to find the simplest script to do one thing as possible. Several different scripts that do one thing each well > a script that 
  does a bunch of things. This means there are less things to break.
- They need to be either as easy to use as possible or easy to make macros for.

#### From the Script Library ####

- Welcome Package
  Makes and assigns a blank character when a player joins the game, gives players a macro in their collection tab to create their own 
  character.
    - Requires HTML Builder.
    
- 5th Edition OGL by Roll20 Companion
  Allows spell and ammo tracking (note you might have to enable these in each character sheet individually, for some reason enabling 
  them in the global roll20 campaign settings wont work for me.)  Also enables the !longrest command to refill spell slots which I use 
  in my fancy longrest macro.
  
- Terrain Generator
  Combined with like a billion map assets I uploaded to roll20 and turned into rollable tables, I can randomly generate wilderness 
  battle maps and it's heckin awesome.
  
- TokenNameNumber
  Add %%NUMBERED%% to the name off a baddy you're about to use in a group and bam, they each get numbered when you drag them to the map.
  
- Areas of Effect
  I can create pretty spell effects using this macro which players can "draw" onto the battlemap using the AOE menu. It's really handy.
    - Requires Vector Math, Path Math, MatrixMath.
  
- Message of the Day
  Whispers a mesage of the day to each player when they enter the game for the first time in like 6 hours.  Really useful for recaps
  and the like, or announcing new macros or roll20 functionality for the PCs to use.
  
- ChatSetAttr
  This script allows you to change the attributes of any character from the chat. It's extremely powerful and equally complicated. I use
  this script to make my longrest and shortrest macros work.
  
- Bump
  Lets me move tokens while they're hidden on the GM layer, and move them between GM and token layer easily.
  
- GroupInitiative
  Lets me roll group initiative for a group of selected tokens with a nice looking format and lets me choose to roll mean, highest, 
  lowest, or individual. I have a macro to make these choices easy.
  
- GroupCheck
  Lets me make group saves, checks, and skill checks by selecting groups of tokens. Offers choice of whisper or public and looks nice.
  
- Roll20 Audio Master
  Allows chat to change or play sound effects. Real complciated, but I just used it to add a "ding" sound to the turntimer script.
  
- TokenMod
  Allows chat to change token attributes. I use this for a status effect macro that standardizes status effects (without all the over-
  head that comes with some complicated status effect scripts.)
  
- Marching Order
  Allows me to set a group of tokens to follow one token. Really useful for exploring dungeons without having to constantly yell at
  everyone to move their tokens faster.
  
#### From External Sources ###

- Turn Timer
  Allows me to set a simple turn timer. My version plays a sound when the time is up. (My version requires a sound effect called 
  "Ding" and the Roll20AM script)

- Table Export (And Import)
  Allows me to import any table I can copy paste into a spreadsheet into roll20, and allows me to export and import tables between
  campaigns more easily.

- Languages
  There are other scripts that do this, but I decided to go for simplicity over fanciness. This script lets someone type !<language> 
  to whisper a message to all who have that language on their sheet + the GM. So for example !draconic only goes to people with
  draconic on their sheet.
